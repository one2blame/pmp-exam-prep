# Tailoring

Each project is unique, as good project managers we must be able to **tailor**
our project development methods based on the needs of the project and its
objectives, stakeholders, governance, and the environment. **Tailoring** is
iterative, and therefore is a continuous process throughout the project.

Project teams should discuss and decide on the **delivery approach** and
**resources** on a project-by-project basis. A **tailored** project can produce
benefits, such as:

* Deeper commitment from project team members
* Reduction in waste in terms of actions or resources
* Customer-oriented focus
* More efficient use of project resources
