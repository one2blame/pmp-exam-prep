# Complexity

**Complexity** is the outcome of human behavior, system interactions,
uncertainty, and ambiguity. As project managers, we should constantly evaluate
and navigate project complexity so that approaches and plans enable the project
team to successfully navigate the entire project.

**Complexity** can be introduced by events or conditions and arise at any
point during the project. **Complexity** is difficult to forecast; project teams
must continually identify complex elements and use different tools and
techniques to reduce the amount or impact of complexity.

Common sources of complexity are:

* Human behavior
* System behavior
* Uncertainty and ambiguity
* Technological innovation
