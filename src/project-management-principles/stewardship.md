# Stewardship

**Stewardship** is the act of taking care of, managing something, for example
property, an organization, money or valuable objects. In the case of PMI,
stewards act sensibly to carry out actions with integrity, care, and
trustworthiness while keeping compliance with internal and external guidelines.
Stewards demonstrate a broad commitment to financial, social, and environmental
impacts of the projects they support. Stewardship has responsibilities both
within and external to the company.

**Stewardship** includes:

* Integrity
* Care
* Trustworthiness
* Compliance
