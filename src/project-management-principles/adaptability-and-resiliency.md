# Adaptability and resiliency

**Adaptability** is the ability to respond to changing conditions.
**Resiliency** is the ability to absorb impacts and to recover quickly from a
setback or failure.

Project managers should aim to build **adaptability** and **resiliency** into
the organization's and project team's approaches. A focus on outcomes rather
than outputs facilitates **adaptability**.

Capabilities within a project that support **adaptability** and
**resiliency** are:

* Short feedback loops to adapt quickly
* Continuous learning and improvement
* Regular inspection and adaptation
* Open and transparent planning that engages stakeholders
* Small-scale prototypes and experiments
* Open organizational conversations
* Diverse project teams with broad skill sets, cultures, and experience
* Understanding from past learning
