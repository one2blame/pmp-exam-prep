# Change

As project managers, we should enable **change** to achieve the envisioned
future state. We must prepare those that are impacted for the acceptance to go
from the **current state** to the **intended future state** created by the
project output.

A **structured approach** will help individuals, groups, and the organization
transition from the current state to a future desired state. Not all
stakeholders will embrace change, and stakeholder engagement and motivational
approaches assist in **change adoption**.

Knowing and addressing the needs of **stakeholders** to embrace change
throughout the project life cycle helps to integrate the resulting change in the
project work, making a successful outcome more likely.
