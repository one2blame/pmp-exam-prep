A **program** is a group of related projects managed in a coordinated way to
obtain benefits and control not available from managing them individually. Some
aspects of **programs** are provided below:

always have projects
* **Program** focus on project interdependencies and helps to determine the
optimal approach for managing all subsequent projects
