# Operations management

**Operations management** most likely won't be covered during the exam, but
Andrew Ramdayal's course defines a specific delineation between
**operations management** and **project management**.

**Operations management** deals with the ongoing production of goods and
services, considering the acquisition, development, and utilization of resources
that organizations need to deliver goods and services.

Unlike projects, **operations** are not temporary and don't have a end date or
lifespan.
