# Organization structures

This section breaks down functional organizations and their concepts and the
attributes of **weak**, **balanced**, and **strong** structures of an
organization.

## Functional organizations

This is a structure for an organization that groups staff members according to
their area of expertise (sales, marketing, construction, etc.). In a more
functionally structured organization, project managers report directly to their
respective functional manager.

## Matrix organizations

This topic primarily denotes that there are three common structures for the
relationship between functional managers and project managers within an
organization:

* **Weak**
  * The project manager has little power
  * The resource availability is low
  * The functional manager controls the budget
  * The project manager and project staff work part-time
* **Balanced**
  * The project manager has moderate power
  * The resource availability is moderate
  * The functional manager and project manager share budget responsibility
  * The project manager and project staff work part-time or full-time
* **Strong**
  * The project manager has the most power
  * The resource availability is high
  * The project manager controls the budget
  * The project manager and project staff work full-time

## Project oriented organizations (projectized)

This is an organizational structure within an organization wherein the project
manager has the greatest amount of authority. The project team is assigned to
the project on a full-time basis and, when the project is complete, the team
members move on to other assignments within the organization.
