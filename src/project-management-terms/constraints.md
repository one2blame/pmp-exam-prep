encounter.

## Project constraints

The following are project constraints defined in the PMP:

* Scope - the work that needs to get done
* Schedule - the constraint of time
* Cost - the amount of money alloted to complete the project
* Risk - threats to the project and its completion
* Quality - ensure the project meets the customer's standards
* Resources - availability of necessary materials to complete the project
