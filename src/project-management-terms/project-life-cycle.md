# Project life cycle

A **project life cycle** is a representation of the **phases** that a project
typically experiences from start to finish. **Project life cycles** can either
be predictive or adaptive. **Change driven** project life cycles have the
following characteristics:

* iterative
* incremental
* adaptive

Plan-driven, predictive **project life cycles** are considered **traditional**.
