# Stakeholder performance domain

The **stakeholder performance domain** addresses activities and functions
associated with stakeholders. This domain focuses on a productive working
relationship with stakeholders throughout the project. Stakeholders have to be
in agreement with project objectives.

In order to achieve performance in this domain, we must define and share a
clear vision at the start of the project, enabling a good relationship and
alignment with stakeholders.

**Effective stakeholder engagement** follows this process:

* Identify - identification of who our stakeholders are, both internal and
external
* Understand - the project manager and team should seek to understand
stakeholders' feelings, emotions, beliefs, and values
* Analyze - same as above
* Prioritize - focus on stakeholders with the most power and interest as one
way to prioritize engagement
* Engage - work collaboratively with stakeholders to introduce the project,
elicit requirements, manage expectations, resolve issues, negotiate, prioritize,
problems solve, and make decisions
* Monitor - throughout the lifetime of the project, stakeholders will change as
new stakeholders are identified and others cease to be stakeholders

Below are our **outcomes** and things we should check when evaluating our
performance in the **stakeholder domain**:

* A productive working relationship with stakeholders throughout the project -
productive working relationships with stakeholders can be observed
* Stakeholder agreement with project objectives - a significant number of
changes or modifications to the project and product requirements in addition to
the scope may indicate stakeholders are not engaged or aligned with the project
objectives
* Stakeholders who are project recipients are supportive and satisfied;
stakeholders who may oppose the project or its deliverables do not negatively
impact project results - stakeholder behavior can indicate whether project
recipients are satisfied and supportive of the project or whether they oppose
it. Survey, interviews, and focus groups are important to receive feedback. A
review of the project issue register and risk register can identify challenges
associated with individual stakeholders.

This process is continual and loops.
