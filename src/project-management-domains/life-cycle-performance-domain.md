# Life cycle performance domain

This domain is related to the activities and functions associated with the
development approach, cadence, and life cycle phases of the project. Delivery
cadence refers to the timing and frequency of project deliverables. The outcomes
of this domain include:

* Correct development approaches
* A project life cycle that connects the delivery of business and stakeholder
value from the beginning to the end of the project
* A project life cycle consisting of phases that facilitate the delivery cadence
and development approach required to produce the project deliverables

Projects can have a **single delivery** or **multiple deliveries** or
**periodic deliveries**. A development approach is the means used to create and
evolve the product, service, or result during the project life cycle. There are
different development approaches - three common ones include:

* Predictive
* Adaptive, including iterative and incremental
* Hybrid

**Outcomes** for this domain and how to check the performance of this domain
include:

* Development approaches are reliable with project deliverables -
  * This can be confirmed by ensuring that the development approach for
deliverables reflects the product variables and is suitable for the project and
the organization
* A project life cycle that connects stakeholders to value from the beginning to
the end of the project
  * Project work from start to end should be represented in project phases
* Phases should facilitate delivery cadence and development approach to create
deliverables
  * The cadence for development, testing, and deployment is represented in the
life cycle phases
