# Project management domains

**Domains** are a group of related activities that are critical to the
**effective delivery of project outcomes**. **Domains** are:

* interactive
* interrelated
* interdependent
* integrated

**Domains** work in unison to achieve project outcomes and delivery of a
project. The following are a list of the **performance domains**:

* Stakeholders
* Team
* Development approach and life cycle
* Planning
* Project work
* Delivery
* Measurement
* Uncertainty

The [project management principles](../project-management-principles/project-management-principles.md) we discussed earlier are our behavioral
guide for each of the **project performance domains**.
