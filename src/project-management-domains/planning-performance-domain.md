# Planning performance domain

This domain is related to the activities and functions associated with the
initial, ongoing, and evolving organization and coordination necessary for
delivering project deliverables and outcomes. Outcomes of this domain include:

* The project moves in an organized, coordinated, and deliberate manner
* There is an holistic approach to providing the project outcomes
* Evolving information is elaborated
* Time spent planning is appropriate
* Planning is sufficient to manage stakeholder expectations
* There is a process for the adaptation of plans

The volume, timing, and frequency of planning varies. Variables of planning
include, but are not limited to:

* Development approach
* Project deliverables
* Organizational requirements
* Market conditions
* Legal or regulatory restrictions

When planning, things to consider will be:

* Delivery - scope being delivered by the project
* Estimating - scope, schedule, budget of resources both people and physical
* Schedules - models used to determine when work has to be done
* Budget - how much will work cost

Planning for how the team will be made begins with identifying the skills sets
required to accomplish the project work. Communication planning overlaps with
stakeholder identification, analysis, prioritization, and engagement.

## Axioms

Below are some axioms related to the **planning performance domain**:

* Physical resources apply to any resource that is not a person
* Procurements can happen at any time during a project
* There will be changes throughout the project
* Some changes are a result of a risk event and others are due to customer
requests or other reasons

## Outcomes and checks

Below is a table of outcomes and methods to check that a project manager is
meeting those outcomes:

| Outcome | Check |
| :--- | :--- |
| The project moves in an organized, coordinated, and deliberate manner | A performance review of project results against the project baselines |
| There is a holistic approach to delivering the project outcomes | The delivery schedule, funding, resource availability and procurements |
| Evolving information is elaborated to produce the deliverables and outcomes | Initial information about deliverables and requirements compared to current information can demonstrate appropriate elaboration |
| Time spent planning is appropriate for the project | Project plans and documents demonstrate the correct level of planning |
| Planning information is sufficient to manage stakeholder expectations | The communications management plan and stakeholder analysis indicate that the communications are sufficient to manage stakeholder expectations |
| There is a process for the adaption of plans throughout the project | Projects using a backlog show the adaption of plans throughout the project. Projects using a change control process have change |
